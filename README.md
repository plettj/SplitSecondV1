# Split Second V1

This is the original source code of the game [Split Second](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-split-second), before it blew up.

We built it from complete scratch in 24 hours, and after winning JamHacksV, Josiah decided to spend the next year making it a full-blown game.

## Where can I play it

You can play Verson 1 [here](https://play-split-second.web.app/), or find its original DevPost submission [here](https://devpost.com/software/split-second).

Version 2, the main guy, can be played [on Coolmath Games](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-split-second), or on my site [plett.fun](https://plett.fun/split-second).

## Code

This code is a solid (if outdated) base for static single-page web games.

- Uses custom physics and drawing on [HTML5 Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp), so you can see all the inner workings.
- It's how I built the first version of [Pentris](https://plett.fun/pentris) in just 2 hours.
- Easily hostable with [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) (even if you know nothing about hosting).
